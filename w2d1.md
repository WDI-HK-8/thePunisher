# Assessment
## Week 2
#### Day 1

##### ThePunisher


The punisher is gonna get started in class. First we need a function that randomizes all the posibly punishments and returns one:

```js
var punishment = function(){
<<<<<<< HEAD
	var x = Math.random() * 9;
	if(x < 1) {
		return "Buy/make coffee and serve everyone."
	}
	else if(x<2) {
		return "Write a blog post."
	}
	else if(x<3) {
		return "Come to next class in formal attire."
	}
	else if(x<4) {
		return "Sing/dance in front of class."
	}
	else if(x<5) {
		return "Stand in the corner for one hour."
	}
	else if(x<6) {
		return "Bow to everyone and apologize seriously."
	}
	else if(x<7) {
		return "Push up *2 for every min late."
	}
	else if(x<8) {
		return "Jog to ferry pier during lunch and take a selfie."
	}
	else {
		return "End convo with 'lunch is coming' until lunchtime."
	}
